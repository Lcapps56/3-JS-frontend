**Reflection**
Sorta difficutl to know what areas to focus on with JS. I can still have a good understanding of the basics. my main challenge here was remebering basic syntax and how to use certain methods, which all came back rather quickly

**NEXT**
I still want to ensure I have a great understandign of JS before moving into heavier code. I want to focus on more OOP and pure JS projects
